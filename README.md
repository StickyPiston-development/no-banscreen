# No Banscreen

This is a mod to disable the newly added ban screen. 
Server owners are the people that should handle bans, 
and not microsoft. 
With this mod you should be able to join 19.0 - 1.8.9 using viaversion.
Think about servers like hypixel & cubecraft.  

(We used a part of _Edgeburn's_ mod as base, his original readme is below.)
