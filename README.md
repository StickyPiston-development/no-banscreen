# No Banscreen

This is a mod to disable the newly added ban screen. 
Server owners are the people that should handle bans, 
and not microsoft. 
With this mod you should be able to join multiplayer servers using other auth systems than the default (w.i.p.)
(We used a part of _Edgeburn's_ mod as base, his original readme is below.)
